<b> Description of this project and my role </b> <br>
Hi friends,<br>
         This project is about crowdfunding. As we all know about crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture 
  by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the Internet.In this project we used small
  amounts of capital from a large number of individuals to finace a new business venture. This makes use of the easy accessibility
  of vast networks of people to bring investors and entrepreneurs together and has the potential to increase entrepreneurship by 
  expanding the pool of investors from people funds that can be raised beyond the traditional circle of owners, relatives and capitalists.
